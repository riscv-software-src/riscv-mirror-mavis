# Mavis Contributors

The Mavis project has been going on for many years, with ideas/code from
multiple companies over that time.  This includes companies like AMD,
Motorola, Freescale/NXP, Samsung, SiFive, Facebook, Barcelona
Supercomputing Center, MIPS, etc. just to name a handful.

There are many
